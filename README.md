# Bayesian-IRT-with-stan

This repository shows two exemples of IRT models I developped at different times in my research.

- The file Dynamic IRT for binary and continuous outcomes.stan show the stan code for a model that aims to place parties and public opinion on the exact same lattent dimension using binary and continuous outcomes variables from direct democratic proposals. 

- The file IRT to predict populare support for parliamentary projects.stan displays a model that aims to predict populare support for parliementary projects based on the parlimentary votes on direct democratic issues and populare support for direct democratic projects.
